𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭-
Given a set of dog and cat images. The task is to build a model to predict the category of an animal: dog or cat?

Introduction-
In recent years, image classification has emerged as one of the most critical applications of computer vision. The ability of machines to recognize and classify objects within an image has countless practical applications in fields ranging from medicine to self-driving cars.
At its core, image classification involves using machine learning algorithms to train a computer to recognize objects within an image. CNNs are the most commonly used algorithms for image classification tasks. CNNs are designed to work with image data and are capable of detecting complex features within an image that humans would otherwise miss.
