Forest Area like Sanjay-Gandhi national park Mumbai, Where leopards are having different species, So those species recognized based on spot pattern on their body. Expert knowledge is required to detect those pattern. So, we developed an software algorithm with AI based camera tool which helped to classify species of leopard by forest department.

The algorithm achieved an impressive accuracy of 86% on the training and test data. This performance demonstrates the prospect of this system to accurately detect the leopard species. In conclusion, a camera powered by AI algorithms which not only captures wildlife images but also provides classification of animal species is proposed & developed.
